Getting Set Up (Self-Study Instructions)
========================================

.. warning::
   You **MUST** have PUMA2, ARCHER2 and MOSRS accounts setup before starting this section.

.. warning:: 
   These instructions are for use on the UM Training Course held on 28th-30th November 2023. If you are using them for self-study please contact NCAS-CMS for instructions.

.. _archer:
   
Set up your ARCHER2 connection
------------------------------

To use the UM Introduction Tutorials you will first need to ensure you can connect from your local desktop to ARCHER2.

SSH key files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before you try and connect to ARCHER2, you need to make sure that you have the ssh-keys available on your computer.
In these instructions, we've assumed the keys are called ``id_rsa_archer2`` and ``id_rsa_archer2.pub``. Replace with the name of your keys as appropriate.

Hopefully you remembered to bring your ARCHER2 ssh-key with you on a USB stick.  Please talk to a course tutor if you have forgotten it.

Copy your ssh-key from the USB stick to the ``~/.ssh`` directory.


.. _terminal:

Connecting via a Terminal (GNU/Linux & macOS)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Connecting via a terminal with an X11 connection (`XQuartz <https://www.xquartz.org/>`_ is also required when using macOS)

Login to ARCHER2: ::

  ssh -Y -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_archer2 <archer2-username>@login.archer2.ac.uk

To simplify the login process, you can define a ``~/.ssh/config`` file entry containing the necessary information. For example: ::

  Host archer2
  Hostname login.archer2.ac.uk
  User <archer2_username>
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_archer2
  ForwardX11 yes
  ForwardX11Trusted yes

so that you can connect using just the command: ::
  
  ssh archer2

Set up your ARCHER2 environment 
--------------------------------

Login to ARCHER2 from your local desktop, copy the following profile to your home directory. :: 

  archer2$ cp /work/y07/shared/umshared/um-training/rose-profile ~/.profile

Change the permissions on your ``/home`` and ``/work`` directories to enable the NCAS-CMS team to help with any queries: ::

  chmod -R g+rX /home/n02/n02/<your-username>
  chmod -R g+rX /work/n02/n02/<your-username>

.. _puma2:

Set up your PUMA2 connection 
----------------------------

PUMA2 is accessed from the ARCHER2 login nodes, and you will use the same username and password.

From an ARCHER2 terminal type: ::

    archer2$ ssh -Y puma2

and type your ARCHER2 password when prompted. 

You should now be logged into PUMA2. To go back to the ARCHER2 login nodes, type ``exit``. 

Set up passwordless access to PUMA2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can set up a passphrase-less ssh-key to allow you to connect to PUMA2 without typing a password or passphrase. 

.. note:: We would never normally advise using an ssh-key without a passphrase, but in this case it is safe to do so since we are already authenticated within the ARCHER2 system.

From the ARCHER2 login nodes, type: :: 

   archer2$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_puma2

At the prompt, press enter for an empty passphrase.

Copy the key over to PUMA2: ::

   archer2$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_puma2 puma2

Type in your ARCHER2 password when prompted.

Next, create a file called ``~/.ssh/config`` (if it doesnâ€™t already exist), and add the following lines: ::

   Host puma2
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_puma2
   ForwardX11 yes

Test it works by typing: :: 

   archer2$ ssh puma2

You should not be prompted for your password. Note that this should have set up X11 forwarding, so you no longer need the ``-Y`` option.

.. warning:: You should never use a passphrase-less key to access the ARCHER2 login nodes, as this is a serious security risk. 

Set up your PUMA2 environment
-----------------------------

Copy our standard ``.profile`` and ``.bashrc`` files: :: 

   puma2$ cd
   puma2$ cp ~um1/um-training/puma2/.bash_profile .
   puma2$ cp ~um1/um-training/puma2/.bashrc . 

Logout of PUMA2 and back in again to pick up these changes. 

You will get a warning about not being able to find ``~/.ssh/ssh-setup``.  This can be ignored and will be resolved in the next step.

You should also be prompted for your Met Office Science Repository Service password, then username. Note that it asks for your **password** first.

Remember your MOSRS username is one word; usually firstnamelastname, all in lowercase. 

If the password caching works, you should see: ::

   Subversion password cached
   Rosie password cached

This means you can now access the code and roses suites stored in the Met Office respositories. 

.. note:: The cached password is configured to expire after 12 hours. Simply run the command ``mosrs-cache-password`` to re-cache it if this happens. Also if you know you won't need access to the repositories during a login session then just press return when asked for your MOSRS password.

Finally, change the permission on your PUMA2 ``/home`` space: :: 

   chmod -R g+rX /home/n02/n02/<your-username>

.. _ssh-setup:

Set up your ssh-agent
---------------------

In order to submit jobs to ARCHER2 from PUMA2, you will need to set up an ``ssh-agent`` and use it to cache the passphrase to your ARCHER2 key. 

**i. Copy your ARCHER2 ssh-key pair to PUMA2** 

Your ARCHER2 key is the one that you use to ssh into the ARCHER2 login nodes.  You need to copy both the public and private keys into your ``.ssh/`` directory on PUMA2.

Open a new terminal from wherever you originally connected to ARCHER2 in :ref:`archer`, and run the following command ::

   scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa_archer2* <archer2-username>@login.archer2.ac.uk:/home/n02/n02-puma/<archer2-username>/.ssh

**ii. Start up your ssh-agent**

First copy the ``ssh-setup`` script to your ``.ssh/`` directory. ::

   puma2$ cp ~um1/um-training/setup/ssh-setup ~/.ssh

Next log out of PUMA2 and back in again to start up the ``ssh-agent`` process. You should see the following message :: 

   Initialising new SSH agent...

**iii. Add your ARCHER2 key**

Add your ARCHER2 key to the ``ssh-agent``, by running ::

   puma2$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa_archer2

Enter your passphrase when prompted. If the passphrase has been cached successfully you should see a message like this: ::

   Identity added: /home/n02/n02/<archer2-username>/.ssh/id_rsa_archer2

The ``ssh-agent`` will continue to run even when you log out of PUMA2. However, it may stop from time to time, for example if PUMA2 is rebooted.  For instructions on what to do in this situation see :ref:`restarting-agent` in the Appendix.

**iv. Configure access to the ARCHER2 login nodes**

Create a file ``~/.ssh/config`` (if it doesn't already exist), and add the following lines: ::

   # ARCHER2 login nodes
   Host ln* 
   IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_archer2

**iv. Verify the setup is correct**

To test this is all working correctly, run: ::

   puma2$ rose host-select archer2

This should return one of the login nodes, e.g. ``ln01``. If it returns a message like ``[WARN] ln03: (ssh failed)`` then something has gone wrong with the ssh setup.

You are now ready to try running a UM suite!
