<h2>4.1. Setting up your default text editor<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-up-your-default-text-editor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When you attempt to create a branch or commit changes to the repository, you will normally be prompted to edit your commit log message using a text editor. The system chooses its editor by searching for a non-empty string through a hierarchy of environment variables in this order: SVN_EDITOR, VISUAL, and EDITOR. Note that the editor you select must able to run in the foreground. For example, you can add one of the following in your <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$HOME/.profile</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$HOME/.kshrc</span></code> (Korn) or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$HOME/.bashrc</span></code> (Bash):</p>

<h2>4.2. Applying modifications to a UM suite<a class="headerlink" href="#applying-modifications-to-a-um-suite" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now that you’ve run a basic suite, you need to know how to apply changes to the trunk code.  We’ll start by applying existing changes (aka a branch) to your suite.  A branch equates to a copy of the UM source code tree with user modifications.  A branch can contain changes to many code files.</p>
<p>As a user, you will be supplied with the <strong>URL</strong> and possibly a version number of a branch.  FCM keywords can be used to specify the URL which is a way of using shorthand for standard bits of the URL path.  For example, this branch has been created in the MOSRS UM repository:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">https</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">//</span><span class="n">code</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">metoffice</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">gov</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">uk</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">um</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">main</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">branches</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">dev</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">rosalynhatcher</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">vn10</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="n">_um_shell1</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A shorter way to specify this is:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">fcm</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">um</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">br</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">dev</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">rosalynhatcher</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">vn10</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="n">_um_shell1</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This branch contains a code change to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">um_shell</span></code> to print:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Tutorial</span> <span class="pre">Change:</span> <span class="pre">Start</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">UM</span> <span class="pre">RUN</span> <span class="pre">Job:</span></code> instead of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Start</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">UM</span> <span class="pre">RUN</span> <span class="pre">job:</span></code></p>
<p>To add this branch go to the panel <em>fcm_make -&gt; env -&gt; sources</em> and in the <strong>um_sources</strong> box add the URL:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">branches</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">dev</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">rosalynhatcher</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">vn10</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="n">_um_shell1</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now <strong>Save</strong> your suite and then submit it either by running <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rose</span> <span class="pre">suite-run</span></code> or clicking the “Play” button in the rose edit GUI.</p>
<p>When the suite has completed, check the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">job.out</span></code> file to verify that you have got the changed output message:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Tutorial</span> <span class="pre">Change:</span> <span class="pre">Start</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">UM</span> <span class="pre">RUN</span> <span class="pre">Job:</span></code> instead of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Start</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">UM</span> <span class="pre">RUN</span> <span class="pre">job:</span></code></p>

<div class="section" id="opening-a-ticket">
<h2>4.3. Opening a Ticket<a class="headerlink" href="#opening-a-ticket" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>All code changes destined for the UM trunk must have an associated Trac Ticket documenting the change (e.g. <a class="reference external" href="https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/um/ticket/1957">https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/um/ticket/1957</a>).  For all other changes creating a ticket to document your change is entirely optional.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">For full details on the UM working practices including the review and commit to trunk process please see <a class="reference external" href="https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/um/wiki/working_practices">https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/um/wiki/working_practices</a>.  If you are planning to make a code change intended for the trunk please make sure you read this before starting the change.</p>
</div>
<p>We will now create a ticket for our code change. Navigate to the UM Trac page on MOSRS: <a class="reference external" href="https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/um">https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/um</a> (You will be prompted to login to MOSRS if you haven’t already done so). Click on <strong>New Ticket</strong>.  A form entitled <strong>Create New Ticket</strong> should appear. For the purposes of this tutorial fill in the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Summary</strong>: <em>“Code change for UM Tutorial”</em></li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: provide as much detail as possible so that all reading the ticket are able to understand the planned change. You can use WikiFormatting to enhance the readability of your text.</li>
<li><strong>Type</strong>: select <em>“task”</em></li>
<li><strong>Milestone</strong>: select <em>“Not for Builds”</em>; this indicates the ticket is not intended for the UM trunk. If your change is intended for the trunk this should be set to the UM release the change is being targeted at: e.g. <em>“UM10.6 code release”</em></li>
<li><strong>Severity</strong>: leave this as <em>“minor”</em></li>
<li><strong>Component</strong>: select <em>“General”</em></li>
<li><strong>cc</strong>: leave this empty</li>
<li><strong>Owner</strong>: assign the ticket to yourself by selecting your username from the drop down list.</li>
</ul>
<p>A preview of your ticket should appear at the bottom of the page.  If if doesn’t appear automatically, use the <strong>Preview</strong> button to inspect your ticket before using the <strong>Create ticket</strong> button to create the ticket.</p>
<p>Remember the number of your new ticket as you will need it later in this tutorial.</p>

<div class="section" id="making-code-changes">
<h2>4.4. Making Code Changes<a class="headerlink" href="#making-code-changes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The default text editor for entering commit messages is <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">vi</span></code>.  If you would prefer to use a different editor; for example <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">emacs</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">vim</span></code>, please see the section on “Setting up your default text editor”.</p>
<p><strong>i. Creating a branch</strong></p>
<p>Firstly create a new directory (e.g. <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">um/branches</span></code>) in your <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$HOME</span></code> directory on PUMA which will be your work area and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cd</span></code> to it.</p>
<p><strong>Using the FCM GUI to create a branch:</strong></p>
<p>A basic FCM GUI was originally created as an interface to the command line functionality of FCM.  However, most people find that for the majority of tasks in FCM it is actually simpler and quicker to use the command line so that is what we will generally use in this tutorial!</p>
<p>However, for branch creation we will show the GUI too.</p>
<p>Launch the GUI from the command line by typing:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>puma$ fcm gui
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Once you have the FCM GUI open, click on <strong>Branch</strong> on the top menu bar of the GUI.</p>
<p>By default, the <strong>create</strong> radio button should be checked, but if it isn’t then check this option.  Set up your branch details as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Enter <strong>fcm:um.x-tr&#64;vn10.5</strong> for the URL of the repository.</li>
<li>Enter a short branch name.  This must contain only alpha-numeric characters and/or underscores; e.g. tutorial</li>
<li>Leave branch type as the default <strong>dev</strong>. This will ensure the branch you create is a user development branch.</li>
<li>Leave the source type as <strong>trunk</strong> and leave the prefix option as <strong>normal</strong>.</li>
<li>Enter the related Trac ticket number for the ticket you created earlier.</li>
</ul>
<p>Click on <strong>Run</strong> when you are ready.  You will be prompted to edit the message log file.  A standard template is automatically supplied and pops up in your default text editor.  However, if you want to add extra comment for the branch, please do so above the line that says <em>“–This line will be ignored and those below will be inserted automatically–”</em>.  When you are ready, save your change and exit the editor.  Answer <strong>Ok</strong> when you are prompted to go ahead and create the branch.</p>
<p>In the output window at the bottom of the GUI, you should hopefully see that your branch has been created successfully.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/create_branch.png"><img alt="_images/create_branch.png" src="_images/create_branch.png" style="width: 748px; height: 550px;" /></a>
<p>The branch will have a URL (location of repository) like this:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/um/main/branches/dev/[userid]/vn10.5_[branch_name]</span></code></p>
<p>Selecting the prefix option <strong>normal</strong> prepends the revision of the trunk you have branched from to your branch name.  Here, as we have used version labelling it is <strong>vn10.5</strong>.  If you had entered a version number instead of a label FCM would have added rxxx where xxx is the revision number.</p>
<p>Take a note of the revision number the branch was created at, and the branch name, vn10.5_[branch_name].</p>
<p>You can see your branch from within the MOSRS Trac (<a class="reference external" href="https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/um">https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/um</a>): Click on <strong>Browse Source</strong> on the Trac menu bar and then navigate through:</p>
<p><strong>main–&gt;branches–&gt;dev–&gt;[userid]</strong></p>
<p>Your branch will also appear on the UM repository mirror held on PUMA (within 5 minutes): <a class="reference external" href="https://puma.nerc.ac.uk/trac/um.xm">https://puma.nerc.ac.uk/trac/um.xm</a></p>
<p><strong>Command line syntax for creating a branch</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned previously it is also possible to create a branch on the command line:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">fcm</span> <span class="n">branch</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">create</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">k</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">xx</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">branch</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">fcm</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">um</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="nd">@vnx</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">y</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Where <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-k</span> <span class="pre">&lt;xx&gt;</span></code> is used to associate ticket number xx with the branch and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">vnx.y</span></code> is the UM version at which this branch should be created (e.g. vn10.5)</p>
<p><strong>ii. Making changes to a working copy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Checking out a working copy</strong></p>
<p>You may have noticed that creating a branch does not create a source code tree that you can edit (working copy)!  To do this you need to <em>Checkout</em> from your branch.  Make sure you have changed to the working directory you created earlier as by default code is checked out to the current directory.  To checkout a copy of the UM code type:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">fcm</span> <span class="n">checkout</span> <span class="n">URL</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Where URL is the url of your branch.  This can be supplied in it’s full form:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/um/main/branches/dev/[userid]/vn10.5_[branch_name]</span></code></p>
<p>or by a shorter way:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fcm:um.x-br/dev/[userid]/vn10.5_[branch_name]</span></code></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>In the second form we have replaced the leading part of the Subversion URL <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/um/main/branches</span></code> with the FCM repository keyword <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fcm:um.x-br</span></code>.  Keywords are shortcuts to save you from having to type in the full URL.</li>
<li>As we have not specified a local directory PATH in the checkout command, it will create a working copy in your current working directory, using the basename of the URL you are checking out.  For example, when you checkout the branch you have just created, the command should create the working copy in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">$PWD/vn10.5_[branch_name]</span></code>. Make a note of the location of your working copy, in case you forget where you have put it.</li>
<li>We are also not specifying a revision to checkout, so it will checkout the HEAD, i.e. the latest revision.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Changing code</strong></p>
<p>Back in the work area directory you created at the beginning of branch creation you should now see that a new directory has appeared and that it is named the same as your branch.  This is your <em>working copy</em>. cd into this directory and explore the code structure to familiarise yourself with how the code is structured.</p>
<p>Now make some code changes! Use the following scenario to take you through the basic method of changing, adding and deleting files:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Change to the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">src/control/top_level/</span></code> sub-directory in your working copy.</li>
<li>Edit <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">um_shell.F90</span></code>, using your favourite editor</li>
<li>Go to the line that says <strong>CALL umPrint(‘I am PE ‘//TRIM(str(mype))//’ on ‘//TRIM(env_myhost),</strong></li>
<li>Change: ‘I am PE’ to ‘Hello World PE’</li>
<li>Go to the line that says <strong>of UM RUN Job :</strong></li>
<li>Change: ‘of UM RUN Job :’ to ‘of UM Tutorial RUN Job:’</li>
<li>Save your changes and exit the editor</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Adding a new file</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Still in the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">src/control/top_level</span></code> directory, add a new file with a subroutine in, called <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">um_shell_sub.F90</span></code>.  (An example file is available on PUMA: <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~um/um-training/um_shell_sub.F90</span></code>.  The routine <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">umPrint</span></code> should be used for writing out messages rather than standard FORTRAN <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">WRITE</span></code> statements.)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Run <strong>fcm add</strong> on the command line, to let the repository know you’re adding a new file at the next commit. Make sure you are still in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">src/control/top_level</span></code> and then type:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">fcm</span> <span class="n">add</span> <span class="n">um_shell_sub</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">F90</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div>at the command prompt.</div></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Amend <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">um_shell.F90</span></code> to call this new subroutine</li>
<li>Ensure you put a comment line <strong>! DEPENDS ON: um_shell_sub</strong> above the CALL statement to ensure the dependency on your new file is registered.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Deleting a file</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">In the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fcm-make/ncas-xc30-ifort</span></code> directory, you should see a file <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">um-createbc-safe.cfg</span></code></p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Run <strong>fcm delete</strong> on the command line, to let the repository know you want to remove this file from your branch: Make sure you are in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fcm-make/ncas-xc30-ifort</span></code> and then type:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">fcm</span> <span class="n">delete</span> <span class="n">um</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">createbc</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">safe</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">cfg</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Getting information about changes to a working copy</strong></p>
<p>All the changes you have made so far have not been committed - i.e. saved to your branch in the repository.  It is possible to list these changes using the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fcm</span> <span class="pre">status</span></code> command.  Firstly, make sure you cd back up to the top level of your working directory and then type:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">fcm</span> <span class="n">status</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>and you should see a list of files taht have been changed.  If you’ve followed the example scenario above you should see output similar to this:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>ros@puma$ fcm status
D       fcm-make/ncas-xc30-ifort/um-createbc-safe.cfg
M       src/control/top_level/um_shell.F90
A       src/control/top_level/um_shell_sub.F90
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Notice that each changed file is flagged with a letter that indicates what the change was: <strong>A</strong> for Added, <strong>D</strong> for Deleted and <strong>M</strong> for Modified.</p>
<p><strong>Reverting an uncommitted change</strong></p>
<p>At this point you can undo any changes before committing. Try the following so that you know how to restore a changed file:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Edit <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">src/control/top_level/initial.F90</span></code> to make any change and then save it.</li>
<li>Run <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fcm</span> <span class="pre">status</span></code> again to confirm it has been flagged as Modified.</li>
<li>Run <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fcm</span> <span class="pre">revert</span></code> on the command line: Make sure you are still in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">src/control/top_level</span></code> and then type <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fcm</span> <span class="pre">revert</span> <span class="pre">initial.F90</span></code></li>
<li>Re-run <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fcm</span> <span class="pre">status</span></code> to see that the file is no longer modified.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that <strong>revert</strong> will undo ALL changes to a file relative to your branch. Therefore if you’ve made several uncommitted changes, <strong>revert</strong> will undo them all, not just the last one.</p>
<p><strong>iii. Committing changes</strong></p>
<p>The change in your working copy remains local until you commit it to the repository where it becomes permanent.  If you are planning to make a large number of changes, you are encouraged to commit regularly to your branch at appropriate intervals.  Make sure you are in the top level directory of the working copy and then type:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>puma$ fcm commit
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A text editor will appear to allow you to edit the commit message.  You must add a commit message to describe your change above the line that says <strong>“–This line, and those below, will be ignored–”</strong>.  Your commit will fail if you do not enter a commit message.  Make sure you provide meaningful commit messages (if your change is intended for inclusion in the trunk you should reference your ticket number) as these will show up in the revision logs and can be a useful source of informtion.</p>
<p><strong>DO:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Put a link to the ticket that raises the issues you are addressing using a wiki syntax; e.g. #15.  Putting this as the first item in the commit message means it will show very clearly under Trac what ticket the change relates to.</li>
<li>State the reason for the change</li>
<li>List possible impacts to other users</li>
<li>Use wiki syntax that can be displayed nicely in plain text</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DON’T:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Repeat what’s already stated in the merge template; e.g. statements such as <em>‘merge my branch to the trunk’</em> should be avoided</li>
<li>List the files you have changed. This will already have been included in the commit log by FCM</li>
<li>Use wiki syntax that cannot be displayed nicely in plain text</li>
<li>Be vague. A commit message that just says <em>“Fix”</em> is insufficient!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Save</strong> your change and exit the editor.  Answer <strong>y</strong> when you are prompted to confirm the commit.</p>
<p>If you’ve followed the example scenario above you should see output similar to this:</p>

<p><strong>iv. Getting information about your branch</strong></p>
<p>If you need to find out information about your (or other users’) branches, you can use the <strong>fcm branch info</strong> command.</p>
<p>In the directory where you checked out the code, type:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>puma$ fcm branch-info
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You should see information about your branch revision, when it was last changed and the parent it was created from:</p>

<p><strong>v. Testing that your branch works</strong></p>
<p>Now that you have made a branch you can use it in the suite you were running earlier.  Go back to the section where you added an existing branch to your suite and add your new branch as well.</p>
<p><strong>Save</strong> and then <strong>Run</strong> your suite.</p>
<p>If you have followed the tutorial scenario so far you should find that your suite fails during the <strong>fcm extract</strong> of code.  In the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">job.err</span></code> file for the <em>fcm_make_um</em> task you will see an error message like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>[FAIL] um/src/control/top_level/um_shell.F90: merge results in conflict
[FAIL]     merge output: /home/ros/cylc-run/u-ag954/share/fcm_make/.fcm-make/

[FAIL]     source from location  1: svn://puma/um.xm_svn/main/branches/dev/

rosalynhatcher/vn10.5_example_branch/src/control/top_level/um_shell.F90@29416
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This is because the sample branch and your branch contain modifications to the same file (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">um_shell.F90</span></code>) and so conflict.  The default behaviour of FCM is to fail and force you to resolve the conflict.  The next section explains options for doing this.</p>
<p><strong>vi. Resolving conflicts</strong></p>
<p>In real UM scenarios, there will be working practices for how conflicts are resolved.  It is likely that package branches will be used to merge several developer branches together.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this tutorial we will resolve the conflict by incorporating the change from the other branch in to yours:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><p class="first">In the working copy directory, type:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">fcm</span> <span class="n">merge</span> <span class="n">fcm</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">um</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">br</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">dev</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">rosalynhatcher</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">vn10</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="n">_um_shell1</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
<li><p class="first">You will be prompted to confirm the merge.  Answer <strong>y</strong> to this.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The conflict with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">um_shell.F90</span></code> will be indicated. Please then run <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fcm</span> <span class="pre">status</span></code> to see that the file <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">um_shell.F90</span></code> is flagged with the letter C, identifying it as a Conflict:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>ros@puma$ fcm status
M      .
C       src/control/top_level/um_shell.F90
?       src/control/top_level/um_shell.F90.merge-left.r24655
?       src/control/top_level/um_shell.F90.merge-right.r29333
?       src/control/top_level/um_shell.F90.working
Summary of conflicts:
  Text conflicts: 1
</pre></div>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In order to make the working copy/branch useable, the conflicts must be resolved. To run conflict resolution type:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>puma$ fcm conflicts
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>FCM will now run the file editor/difference tool <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">xxdiff</span></code> and will show a 3 way display:</p>
<p>The file in the middle is the common ancestor from the merge (i.e. the version of code before either of the changes have been applied).  The file on the left contains the changes from your branch and the file on the right is the file containing the changes which you are merging in.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">xxdiff</span></code> is configured to automatically select regions that would end up being selected by an automatic merge (i.e. the changes do not overlap).  Any difference “hunks” which cannot be resolved automatically are left “unselected”.  The number of unresolved changes is shown in the top right hand corner of the xxdiff display, under the Help menu.  In this case it should show 1.</p>
<p>To inspect the differences either scroll through the files using the scrollbars or use keyboard shortcuts <strong>n</strong> to go to the next difference, and <strong>p</strong> to go to the previous one.</p>
<p>If you have followed the tutorial scenario so far you should see that the changes to the header, “My PE” write statement and the addition of call to the new subroutine <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">um_shell_sub</span></code> have been selected automatically by <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">xxdiff</span></code> because they do not overlap.  However, the changes to the other write statement haven’t because they do overlap (they should be highlighted in a different colour to the changes that don’t overlap)</p>
<p>To resolve this conflict, select your write statement “Start of UM Tutorial RUN Job” change by clicking on the text in the file on the left to select it.  You should see that the number of unresolved changes now drops to 0 and the selected text changes colour.</p>
<p>Now select <strong>Exit with MERGED</strong> from the xxdiff File menu.  You will be prompted to run <strong>svn resolved</strong> so answer <strong>y</strong> to this.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that the merge command only applies changes to your working copy.  Therefore, you must commit the change to your branch in order for it to become permanent in the repository.  Before you do that though, it is a good idea to inspect the changes prior to committing.</p>
<p>You have already seen how to use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fcm</span> <span class="pre">status</span></code> to see which files have changed in a working copy.  To see more details, you need to use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fcm</span> <span class="pre">diff</span></code>.  In your working copy directory type:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>puma$ fcm diff -g
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You will get a 2 way diff between your working copy and your branch.  Scroll down to check that the changes you require as a result of the previous merge are correct.</p>
<p>If you are happy, exit the diff and type <strong>fcm commit</strong>.  You will be prompted to edit the commit log as before.  However, you may notice that a standard template is already provided for you.  In most cases, the standard message should be sufficient.  However, if you want to add extra comment to the commit, please do so above the line that says <em>“–This line will be ignored and those below will be inserted automatically–”</em>.  This is useful, for example, if there were significant issues addressed in the merge.  Answer <strong>y</strong> to confirm the commit.</p>
<p>Return to your suite and go to the <em>fcm_make -&gt; env -&gt; sources</em> panel.  Remove the ‘um_shell1’ branch.</p>
<p>Now you have merged in the changes from this branch to your branch and resolved conflicts the ‘um_shell1’ branch is redundant.  <strong>Save</strong> the suite.  Before you can re-run the suite you will need to shutdown the previous failed run.  In the Cylc GUI click on <em>Control -&gt; Stop Suite</em>, select <strong>Stop now</strong> and then click on <strong>Ok</strong>. Now <strong>Run</strong> your suite to verify that all the changes have been applied.</p>
<p>This section of the tutorial has given a very simple example of a conflict resolution.  In practice it can be much less straightforward! A separate tutorial section dedicated to conflict resolution using likely examples from the UM has been created which you can reference/work through should you encounter more complex conflicts in your development work.</p>
<p><strong>Viewing your changes in Trac</strong></p>
<p>Making a change to your branch results in a <strong>changeset</strong> which is basically a record of the changes.  One way of viewing the changeset you have just created is to click on <strong>Timeline</strong> in Trac.  The Timeline view is a sequential record of all events in the repository.  You should see changesets for your original commit to your branch and the subsequent commit after resolving the conflicts near the top.  The changesets are numbered corresponding to the revision of your branch which would have been displayed in the GUI when you did a commit or branch info.  To see all the details click on the line <em>‘Changeset[xxx]…’</em> relating to your changeset.  Alternatively, if you enter the number of the changeset “[<strong>xxx</strong>]” into the search box at the top right, it will take you directly to the numbered changeset.  Your changeset should look something like this:</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/fcm_changeset.png"><img alt="_images/fcm_changeset.png" src="_images/fcm_changeset.png" style="width: 650px; height: 591px;" /></a>
</div>
<div class="section" id="documenting-your-change">
<h2>4.5. Documenting your change<a class="headerlink" href="#documenting-your-change" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Go back to the Trac ticket you created for your code change and add some documentation as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A description of what code has changed</li>
<li>Test results (i.e. Did your suite run? Were there any clashes to resolve?)</li>
<li>Any other information you want to add</li>
<li>As we have finished the change for this tutorial example we will resolve the ticket as <strong>fixed</strong> by clicking <strong>Modify Ticket</strong> and selecting <em>“resolve &amp; assign to &lt;username&gt; as fixed”</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Preview</strong> and <strong>Submit</strong> your ticket to save the changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tidying-up">
<h2>4.6. Tidying Up<a class="headerlink" href="#tidying-up" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If your development is destined for the UM trunk, then once you have finished your code changes and it has been tested and reviewed, your branch will be committed to the project shared package branch by the project owner.  Once this has been done and there are no problems, your branch is essentially redundant.  If no other users are using this branch in their suites it can be deleted.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this tutorial, you can now proceed to delete your branch.  When you delete a branch, it becomes invisible from the HEAD revision, but will continue to exist in the repository should you want to refer to it in the future.</p>
<p><strong>List branches owned by you</strong></p>
<p>If you forget what your branch is called and/or what other branches you have created, you can get a listing of all the branches you have created in a project.  To do this use the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">fcm</span> <span class="n">branch</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nb">list</span> <span class="n">URL</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Where URL is the name of repository you want to search.  In this case it would be fcm:um.x</p>
<p><strong>Delete a branch</strong></p>
<p>Make sure you are in the relevant working copy directory and type:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">fcm</span> <span class="n">branch</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">delete</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You will be prompted to edit the commit message file.  A standard template is automatically supplied for the commit.  However, if you want to add extra comment for the branch, please do so above the line that says <em>“–This line will be ignored and those below will be inserted automatically–”</em>.  Save your changes and exit the editor.</p>
<p>Answer <strong>y</strong> when you are prompted to go ahead and delete this branch.</p>
<p>Your working copy is now pointing to a branch that no longer exists at the HEAD revision of the repository.  It is possible to keep this working copy, create a new branch and switch your working copy to point to the new branch.  Otherwise, you can remove your working copy by issuing a careful <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rm</span> <span class="pre">-rf</span></code> command.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="version-control-of-suites">
<h2>4.7. Version Control of Suites<a class="headerlink" href="#version-control-of-suites" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Just like code changes your UM suites are also under version control in a subversion repository, usually <em>roses-u</em> which is on the MOSRS.  Once you have a working copy of your suite under <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/roses</span></code> you can use FCM commands in the same way as for your source code branches; commit changes, diff changes, etc.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Look in the roses-u repository via MOSRS Trac (<a class="reference external" href="https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/roses-u">https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/roses-u</a>) and find the suite you created in the previous section. (Hint: Go to <em>“Browse Source”</em> then drill down to find you suite. e.g. u-ag263 would be under a/g/2/6/3)</li>
<li>Go to your suite working directory and type <strong>fcm status</strong> to see the changes you have made since you copied the suite.</li>
<li>Run <strong>fcm commit</strong> to commit your changes to the repository.</li>
<li>Look again in the MOSRS roses-u Trac and see that your commit has now appeared in the repository.</li>
</ul>
